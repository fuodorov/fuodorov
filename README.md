### Hi! I'm [**@fuodorov**](https://github.com/fuodorov) (Vyacheslav Fedorov).

I'm software engineer and physicist.

<!-- currently working [@Sibers](https://www.sibers.com) and [@BINP](https://inp.nsk.su/budker-institute-of-nuclear-physics).  -->

<!-- I study accelerator physics and astrophysics at [@NSU](https://english.nsu.ru), [@ITMO](https://en.itmo.ru), [@SibSUTIS](https://sibsutis.ru/en/) and [@BINP](https://www.inp.nsk.su/budker-institute-of-nuclear-physics). 
I'm currently studying software development at [@Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.com). -->

Like any other programmer and passionate professional, I love learning new things and technologies.

> Feynman said, "The ultimate test of your knowledge is your capacity to convey it to another."

Over the past few years, I have been actively studying algorithms, data structures, and web application architecture. Run workshops on complex CS topics for coworkers and friends. I have created courses on ‚ÄúMicroservices Scalable Websites‚Äù and ‚ÄúSoftware Development and Applications in Physics Research‚Äù.

I'm currently a researcher working in the field of accelerator physics.
