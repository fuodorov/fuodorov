### Hi! I'm [**@fuodorov**](https://github.com/fuodorov) (Vyacheslav Fedorov).

I'm software engineer, currently working [@Sibers](https://www.sibers.com). 

I studied accelerator physics and astrophysics at [@NSU](https://english.nsu.ru), [@ITMO](https://en.itmo.ru) and [@BINP](https://www.inp.nsk.su/budker-institute-of-nuclear-physics) for 5 years. 
I'm currently studying software development at [@SibSUTIS](https://sibsutis.ru/en/) and [@Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.com).

Like any other programmer and passionate professional, I love learning new things and technologies. 

<!--
I'm currently a research software engineer at the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics in Novosibirsk, Russia where I help write code for modelling electron beam in linear induction accelerator LIA-20.

- âš¡ Iâ€™m currently studying at ITMO University and at the Yandex School of Data Analytics as a Python developer.
