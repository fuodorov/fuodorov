### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Vyacheslav Fedorov and I'm currently a research software engineer at the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics in Novosibirsk, Russia where I help write code for modelling electron beam in linear induction accelerator LIA-20.

I am currently studying at ITMO University and at the Yandex School of Data Analytics as a Python developer.
